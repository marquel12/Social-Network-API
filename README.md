# Social-Network-API
The purpose of this project is to build an API from scratch for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list

## My thoughts;
As a new coder this was a challenge for me because I had a tough week understanding the concept around mongoose and mongodb. After going back and watching previous zoom recording, I realized this challenge was not as hard as I thought but but there was a lot of coding and time it took me to complete. Creating the models was the easy part. My biggest challenge was understanding how I was going to seed the data for the database. After taking the time to review previous activities, I had a better understanding on how I can seed the data.
